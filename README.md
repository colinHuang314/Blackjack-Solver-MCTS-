# Blackjack-Solver-MCTS-

## Overview
This project is a Blackjack decision solver built using a customized Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) framework. Given any player hand, dealer upcard, game rules, and deck state (including card count), the solver computes the optimal action and expected value (EV). When run at sufficient accuracy, results match industry-standard optimal-play tables and counting deviations. 

The solver has been validated against Blackjack Apprenticeship strategy and deviation tables. See: https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/blackjack-strategy-charts/ and https://www.blackjackapprenticeship.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/BJA_H17.pdf

Unlike classic MCTS implementations, this solver is adapted for Blackjack’s stochastic nature, modeling card draws as chance events.

## Key Features
- Monte Carlo Tree Search–based decision engine
  - Computes optimal actions and EV for hit, stand, double, and split
  - Handles extremely close EV decisions and high-variance situations

- Explicit Chance Node Modeling
  - Separate nodes for:
    - Player actions
    - Random card outcomes (chance nodes)
  
  - Uses probability distributions derived from the remaining shoe
    
- Card Counting & Deviations
  - Integrated Hi-Lo card counting system
  - Can simulate decisions at a specific running or true count
  - Includes a deviation finder to identify count thresholds where optimal decisions change
  - Minor discrepancies may arise depending on deck-remaining estimation and penetration assumptions

- Configurable Accuracy–Speed Tradeoffs
  - Adjustable runtime and iteration limits
  - Optional confidence-based early termination
  - Preset accuracy levels:
    - Low: Fast, correct for most hands
    - Medium: Correct for almost all non-splits and most splits
    - Tuned: Designed for ~99%+ accuracy across all hands

## Customizable Game Rules
The solver supports extensive rule customization, including:
- Number of decks
- Surrender (enabled / disabled)
- Maximum number of splits
- Whether split aces receive only one card
- Dealer rules (e.g., H17 vs S17)
- Blackjack payout structure (if configured)

These rule changes directly affect EV calculations and optimal decisions.

## Simulation & Configuration Options
- Customize:
  - Player hand and dealer upcard
  - Shoe composition and count state
  - Simulation runtime or iteration limits
  - Whether rollouts use basic strategy or unbiased random play
  - Debug / verbose output

## Performance Characteristics
- Benchmark:
  - ~10 million iterations in ~5 minutes
  - ≈ 33,000 iterations/sec on the author’s machine

- Typical convergence (Medium settings):
  - Most hands: 300k – 1M iterations
  - Splits: ~6× longer
  - Extremely close decisions: up to 30M iterations

- Accuracy notes:
  - Using basic strategy rollouts improves convergence speed
  - Non-tuned settings may produce incorrect split decisions
  - EV estimates for splits are particularly sensitive to rollout policy

## Example Deviations to Try
Pair 10s vs 6

Hard 8 vs 6

Hard 16 vs 10

Hard 12 vs 2

Soft 19 vs 6

*Also you can try Soft 19 vs 6 under both H17 and S17 rules to observe rule-dependent decision changes.*

## MCTS Design (Blackjack-Specific)
This solver intentionally departs from classic MCTS:
- Action nodes represent player decisions
- Chance nodes represent possible card draws
- During selection:
  - The best action node is chosen
  - A resulting state is sampled via the card probability distribution (simulateChanceNode)

- During expansion:
  - A chance node is created
  - One child node is added for each possible card outcome from the shoe

This explicit separation improves convergence and EV accuracy in stochastic environments like Blackjack.

## Notes
Some configuration parameters have subtle interactions—tweaking settings may have non-obvious effects on convergence speed and accuracy.
